        <h1><b>Random geometric graphs and the phase transition</b> - Nic K&uuml;pper</h1>
        <p>Random geometric graphs are a large and diverse family of graphs with various interesting properties. The simplest type is the Poisson Boolean model. The vertices are given by a Poisson
           point process and we create an edge for any two points that are sufficiently close. It is driven by a single parameter, the Poisson point process intensity. The main object of interest
           is the phase transition of the graph, driven by the intensity which divides the parameter space into two regions of vastly different behaviours. One particular change is the size of large
           components around the origin.</p>

### Seminar announcement - Workshops ###

        <h1><b>Workshops</b></h1>
        <p>We are hosting a special workshop edition of the Bath Probability &amp; Stochastics Seminar this month. Whether you need some creative brainstorming or have to tackle a tedious calculation,
          bring any probability-related problems you have, or just come and see if anyone needs your help. If you prefer to work alone, this is a great chance to find an accountability buddy to keep you focused.</p>
